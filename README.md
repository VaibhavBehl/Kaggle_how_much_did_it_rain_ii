**Class Rank: #1/45**  

I participated in this competition as part of a team of 3 people. This competition was to serve as the mini-project for a machine learning class(CSCI-567) I took in the fall of 2015 at USC. More than 45 teams from that class competed in this competition(can be identified by the prefix MLCLASS_ on the leaderboard). This repository contains all the code files, visualizations and a pdf report for this competition. This was the first time I had used R language so the code is very adhoc. To see details on how to run, refer- how_to_run.txt. The pdf file- 'MLCLASS_REIGNtheRAIN_mini_project_fall15.pdf' also details the the problem statement and the approach that was used.
